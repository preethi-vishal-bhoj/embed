# Website Starter

A lightweight, responsive starter template (HTML/CSS/JS) that you can customize and deploy anywhere (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).

## Edit locally
1. Open this folder in VS Code or your editor.
2. Change the text in `index.html` (logo, headings, sections).
3. Tweak styles in `styles.css`.
4. Add images to `assets/img/` and update `<img>` tags as needed.

## Preview locally
- Double‑click `index.html` to open in your browser; OR
- Run a simple server from the folder:
  - Python 3: `python3 -m http.server 9000` then open http://localhost:9000

## Next steps (optional)
- Replace `favicon.png` in `assets/img/` with your own.
- Add pages (e.g., `about.html`) and link them from the nav.
- Optimize images (use .webp where possible).

## Deploy
Use any static host. For GitHub Pages:
1. Create a repo.
2. Push these files.
3. In repo Settings → Pages, enable Pages.
4. (Optional) Add your custom domain in Settings → Pages.

Happy building!
